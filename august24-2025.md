## Propositional Logic  
---

### **Proposition**  
**Definition**: A *proposition* is a declarative sentence that is either **true** or **false**.  
> **Examples**:
> - "Today is Tuesday." → **False**  
> - "Des Moines is the capital of Iowa." → **True**  
> - "4 + 2 = 6" → **True**  
> - "x + 1 = 3" → **Not a proposition** (not definitively true or false)  
> - "What is your major?" → **Not a proposition** (a question)  
> - "Follow my steps." → **Not a proposition** (a command)  

**Note**: We often use lowercase letters like `p`, `q`, `r`, `s`, `t` to represent propositional variables.

### **Atomic Proposition**  
**Definition**: An *atomic proposition* is a proposition that **cannot** be broken down into simpler propositions.  
> **Examples**:  
> - `p`: "Today is Monday." → **Atomic**  
> - `q`: "It is the first day of classes." → **Atomic**  
> - `r`: "Today is Monday **and** it is the first day of classes." → **Not atomic** (composed of `p * q`)  
> - `r = p * q` (compound proposition)

---

### **Negation**  
**Definition**: Let `p` be a proposition. The **negation** of `p`, denoted `!p`[^1], is the statement:  
> “It is not true that `p`.”  
> **Examples**:  
> - `p`: "The day is Monday."  
> - `!p`: "The day is not Monday." (or: "It is not true that the day is Monday.")

**Truth Table**:
| `p` | `!p`|
|:---:|:---:|
| T | F |
| F | T |
---

### **Conjunction**  
**Definition**: Let `p` and `q` be propositions. The **conjunction** of `p` and `q`, denoted `p * q`[^2], is the statement:  
> “`p` and `q`” — which is **true only if both `p` and `q` are true**.  
> **Examples**:  
> - `p`: "Today is Monday."  
> - `q`: "It is the first day of classes."  
> - `p & q`: "Today is Monday **and** it is the first day of classes." → **Not atomic**

**Truth Table**:
| `p` | `q`| `p * q` |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| F | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| T | F | F |
| T | T | T |
---

### **Disjunction**  
**Definition**: Let `p` and `q` be propositions. The **disjunction** of `p` or `q`, denoted `p + q`[^3], is the statement:  
> “`p` or `q`” — which is **false only if both `p` and `q` are false**.  
> **Example**:  
> - "Today is Monday **or** it is the first day of classes."

**Truth Table**:
| `p` | `q`| `p + q` |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| F | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| T | F | T |
| T | T | T |
---

### **Symbol Notes**  
[^1]: Use `¬` instead of `!` for **negation**.  
[^2]: Use `∧` instead of `*` for **conjunction**.  
[^3]: Use `∨` instead of `+` for **disjunction**.
